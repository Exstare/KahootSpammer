# CLI Kahoot Spammer
I tried something different and stumbed upon this package: `kahoot-spam`. This gave me the idea to make an CLI tool for this myself, without help. I had suprisingly quite a lot of fun making this, I have no idea why. So here you go, a little CLI tool for spamming Kahoot, which is probarbly buggy AF.

## Setup
> ðŸ“¢ Make sure you have node.js

1. Install the files.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm i chalk kahoot-spam prompt-sync`.
3. Run it with `node .`
4. Follow the instructions and 'enjoy' ðŸ˜‰

> ðŸ“¢  If the code isn't right, or the bots can't join the Kahoot, the terminal will get errors, I don't know how to solve it. So if everyone knows how to fix it, go ahead ðŸ™‚ (You don't have to do the formatting, but you may if you want too! ðŸ˜…)

## Important Note
This application is for private or educational purposes only. Do not use it without permission of the host from the Kahoot. I'm not responsible for any problems you may get. By using this spammer, you automatically accept that you know it violates the guidelines and that I'm never responsible for your problems.
