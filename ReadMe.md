# CLI Kahoot Spammer
I tried something different and stumbed upon this package: `kahoot-spam`. This gave me the idea to make an CLI tool for this myself, without help. I had suprisingly quite a lot of fun making this, I have no idea why. So here you go, a little CLI tool for spamming Kahoot, which is probarbly buggy AF.

## Setup
> ðŸ“¢ Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed!

1. Download the source files.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm i` or `yarn`.
3. Run it with `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Follow the instructions and 'enjoy' ðŸ˜‰

## Important info
There are some issues, which I'm not able to resolve. For instance, it doesn't always spam the right amount of bots. The most I got out of it was a 1000, but it is not that reliable. Expect to have less than the requested amount. I suggest about 500. If something goes wrong, you will recieve an error.
#### TL;DR
- Except less 'users' than the amount you put in
- I suggest about 500 'users'
- It's not 100% reliable

> ðŸ“¢ If you know how to improve the code or fix this issues, go ahead ðŸ™ƒ
